As we have seen in our lectures, the ever-increasing number of solved protein structures by different methods (X-ray, NMR, cryoEM) has enabled to define that, regardless their primary sequence, proteins do not explore all possible configurations. This very simple observation enabled further use of this information to perform statistical analysis of the different conformations that a protein sequences usually explore: typical amino acid environments and distances between amino acids in any given protein, secondary structure predictions based on sequence information alone, angle and distance geometries between secondary structure elements, dihedral distributions of backbones and side chains, etc. Then, this information can be used to define energy functions which enable us to determine which structures are more probable for a given sequence (an inverse folding problem).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ojBSonugasAx"},"source":["While this method has been used for several protein structure predictions, the exponential growth of the conformational space of a protein that can be explored by a given protein sequence with respect to its protein length severely limits its use to proteins with fewer than 100 residues. The rationale behind such exact number is that a protein domain, i.e. considered as a region (sequence) of a protein that can fold independently onto a given structure by its own, typically has a maximum in its typical length distribution at ~100 residues for most proteins (**Fig 1**).
