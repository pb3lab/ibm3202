Briefly:\n","- **Check the VERIFY3D results:** >80% of the residues should have an average score ≥ 0.2, whereas the score profile allows you to identify conflicting regions.\n","- **Check the Ramachandran plot:** Are there any residues outside the allowed regions? What types of residues are found within those regions? (Check it by clicking on each dot in the plot)\n","- **Check the errors in PROCHECK:** are the errors located within the loop regions?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yy_dPWhIVOCp"},"source":["<figure>\n","<center>\n","<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/images/cm_04.png'/>\n","</center>\n","</figure>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L57wIbIJYAiK"},"source":["While we will discuss some of these results at the end of this tutorial, we highly encourage you to read [this article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007449), which contains more recommendations on comparative modelling of protein structures."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IBjMZe5ufofl"},"source":["**This is the end of the fourth tutorial!
