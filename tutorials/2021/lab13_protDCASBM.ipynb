While the chemical nature of the interaction between these residue pairs can vary from one protein to another, the physical contact between these residues is **constrained in the final structure**.\n","\n","Based on this, it was suggested that the **statistical analysis of correlated amino acid substitution patterns at different sequence positions of a protein family** could be exploited to **infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure**.

This value is typically set to one-third (0.3) to one-half (0.5) of the total numer of sequences in the MSA.\n","- APC is the score that we are going to get from the analysis, it corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the coupling matrix between sites $i$ and $j$, which is then average product corrected.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!mfdca compute_fn protein Trimmed_PF01814_2mhr_aligned/Trimmed_PF01814_2mhr_aligned.fa --apc --pseudocount 0.5 --verbose"],"metadata":{"id":"GsXgxEiNvgYb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729440148479,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":491892,"user":{"displayName":"César Ramírez-Sarmiento","userId":"07473609926097268448"}},"outputId":"05146748-4244-4d70-e864-a75dbda48ae2"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:39,920 fasta_reader alignment_letter2int \n","\tFound 23 non-standard residues in 16 sequences\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:39,921 fasta_reader alignment_letter2int \n","\tTotal number of sequences read from file: 22192\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:39,924 meanfield_dca compute_sequences_weight \n","\tComputing sequences weights\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:56,035 meanfield_dca __init__ \n","\tCreated a MeanFieldDCA object with the following attributes\n","        \tbiomolecule: PROTEIN\n","        \ttotal states at sites: 21\n","        \tpseudocount: 0.5\n","        \tsequence identity: 0.8\n","        \talignment length: 118\n","        \ttotal number of unique sequences (excluding redundant sequences with 100 percent similarity): 20851\n","        \teffective number of sequences (with sequence identity 0.8): 14206.842292520356\n","        \n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:56,035 meanfield_dca get_single_site_freqs \n","\tComputing single site frequencies\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:57,031 meanfield_dca get_reg_single_site_freqs \n","\tRegularizing single site frequencies\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 15:54:57,178 meanfield_dca get_pair_site_freqs \n","\tComputing pair site frequencies\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:24,757 meanfield_dca get_reg_pair_site_freqs \n","\tRegularizing pair site frequencies\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:25,035 meanfield_dca construct_corr_mat \n","\tConstructing the correlation matrix\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:25,412 meanfield_dca compute_couplings \n","\tComputing couplings\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:27,292 meanfield_dca compute_couplings \n","\tMaximum and minimum couplings: 10.556115881877309, -82.88600372018409\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:27,292 meanfield_dca compute_sorted_FN \n","\tComputing Frobenius norm of couplings\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:27,764 meanfield_dca compute_sorted_FN_APC \n","\tPerforming average product correction (APC) to Frobenius norm of couplings.\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:27,857 dca_utilities write_sorted_dca_scores \n","\tWriting DCA scores to file MFDCA_output_Trimmed_PF01814_2mhr_aligned/MFDCA_apc_fn_scores_Trimmed_PF01814_2mhr_aligned.txt\n","\u001b[0;32mINFO\u001b[0;0m 2024-10-20 16:02:27,887 mfdca_main run_meanfield_dca \n","\tDONE\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mhWuPHSggJNY"},"source":["4.
