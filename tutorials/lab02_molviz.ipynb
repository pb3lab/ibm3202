Those columns, next to the coordinates, are the occupancy and temperature (or B) factors. The occupancy tells you if the atom is definitely in that position, or if an alternative configuration is also likely. The image in **Figure 1** presents this scenario in a protein structure solved by X-ray crystallography (PDB 6ANE; the same we used in Lab.01), where a given tryptophan residue cannot be univocally assigned to a single configuration (i.e. the electron density is equally fit in both configurations).
