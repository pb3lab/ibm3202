The result from this script are:\n","- A **coordinate** file (extension **.gro**), where each residue of the target sequence is represented by a single bead and given initial positions for starting our folding simulations.\n","- A **topology** file (extension **.top**), which contains the non-bonded interactions from the DCA contacts as Gaussian potentials and the bonded interactions (bonds, angles, dihedrals) drawn from the secondary structure prediction as harmonic potentials.\n","\n","  Upon executing this script, you will be asked to indicate a `DCA maximum force factor`, which controls the force of pairwise potentials that will drive protein folding. A good estimate for the strength of coevolutionary interactions is to consider the force factor equivalent to the ratio of $L$ over the number of DCA pairs (factor = $L$/$|$DCA$|$). Thus, **we will use a value of 1.**"],"metadata":{"id":"dbpIBNmLdk89"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now we download the scripts for generating the topology, coordinates and instructions for simulations."],"metadata":{"id":"lPCt8y51J2kR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Downloading all required files\n","!wget https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/scripts/dcasbm.py\n","!wget https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/scripts/distavg\n","!wget https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/files/sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp"],"metadata":{"id":"9734FlYTHGVw","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729442379931,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2672,"user":{"displayName":"César Ramírez-Sarmiento","userId":"07473609926097268448"}},"outputId":"fa43220a-584a-40ec-ae0f-66cf585b7f24"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2024-10-20 16:39:37--  https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/scripts/dcasbm.py\n","Resolving github.com (github.com)... 20.205.243.166\n","Connecting to github.com (github.com)|20.205.243.166|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found\n","Location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/scripts/dcasbm.py [following]\n","--2024-10-20 16:39:37--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/scripts/dcasbm.py\n","Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.108.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.110.133, ...\n","Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|185.199.108.133|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 7407 (7.2K) [text/plain]\n","Saving to: ‘dcasbm.py’\n","\n","dcasbm.py           100%[===================>]   7.23K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \n","\n","2024-10-20 16:39:37 (81.2 MB/s) - ‘dcasbm.py’ saved [7407/7407]\n","\n","--2024-10-20 16:39:37--  https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/scripts/distavg\n","Resolving github.com (github.com)... 20.205.243.166\n","Connecting to github.com (github.com)|20.205.243.166|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found\n","Location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/scripts/distavg [following]\n","--2024-10-20 16:39:38--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/scripts/distavg\n","Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.108.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.110.133, ...\n","Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|185.199.108.133|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 2711 (2.6K) [text/plain]\n","Saving to: ‘distavg’\n","\n","distavg             100%[===================>]   2.65K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \n","\n","2024-10-20 16:39:38 (39.6 MB/s) - ‘distavg’ saved [2711/2711]\n","\n","--2024-10-20 16:39:38--  https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/raw/master/files/sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp\n","Resolving github.com (github.com)... 20.205.243.166\n","Connecting to github.com (github.com)|20.205.243.166|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found\n","Location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/files/sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp [following]\n","--2024-10-20 16:39:38--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/files/sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp\n","Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.108.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.110.133, ...\n","Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|185.199.108.133|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 5031 (4.9K) [text/plain]\n","Saving to: ‘sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp’\n","\n","sbm_calpha_SA_v5_sh 100%[===================>]   4.91K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \n","\n","2024-10-20 16:39:39 (61.2 MB/s) - ‘sbm_calpha_SA_v5_short.mdp’ saved [5031/5031]\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Then, we generate the topology"],"metadata":{"id":"gSWLvBt3J_sb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python dcasbm.py Jpred.txt predictions_topl.txt"],"metadata":{"id":"Qne1ksBjHKeU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729442387717,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5497,"user":{"displayName":"César Ramírez-Sarmiento","userId":"07473609926097268448"}},"outputId":"f7c06dd0-7074-4bfe-8beb-e9559d1fa40c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\tDCA maximum force factor: 1\n","\n","\tProtein sequence in selected file:\n","\tGWEIPEPYVWDESFRVFYEQLDEEHKKIFKGIFDCIRDNSAPNLATLVKVTTNHFTHEEAMMDAAKYSEVVPHKKMHKDF\n","\n","\tTotal number of residues: 118\n","\n","\tA protein coordinates file was saved in this folder as Jpred_calpha.gro\n","\n","\tA protein topology file was saved in this folder as Jpred_calpha.top\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.
