The **nodes** or branch points connecting two sequences are the points of divergence in sequence evolution, namely **common ancestors** of extant taxa. The connection of two or more sequences with a hypothetical, extinct ancestral sequence allows grouping actual sequences into **clades**. On the other hand, the branch lengths represent the evolutionary changes between an ancestor and its descendant. Please notice that we are saying **'sequences'** and not **'species'**, as such statement requires the assumption of genetic isolation (i.e. all sequences in a given species show the same evolutionary drifts, but we learn from lectures that we can have horizontal gene transfer, right?)."

For example, **initiation codons (typically, ATG)** may not be free to vary at all. Therefore, we should make such sites invariant. On the other hand, we know that positions on the interior of a protein evolve more slowly that surface residues, therefore substitutions have **varying rates** depending on the position of these residues. In the case of variation, modeling these varying rates is computationally consuming, thus a well-behaved, mathematically tractable **gamma distribution** is used for modeling these rate variations."

Now we will starting doing some ML phylogenetics, but **which model should we use?** Well, ML has the advantage that we can use the **log-likelihood** to infer which evolutionary model is more suitable for the alignment being used (neat, isn’t it?).
