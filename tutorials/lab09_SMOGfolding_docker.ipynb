In contrast, the biological processes of greater complexity such as **protein folding, conformational changes and biomolecular interactions**, are in the order of **ms – s**. These phenomena cannot be studied through traditional MD strategies, thus requiring the application of enhanced sampling techniques in order to reach biologically relevant time scales.\n","\n","In this regard, **the energy landscape theory of protein folding** and the **principle of minimum frustration** have provided the basis for the definition of a simplified potential energy function that allows us to explore these processes. This framework established that **the robustness of protein folding during evolution is the result of the selection of sequences that accumulate interactions that mutually support the native state of a protein**, while avoiding the accumulation of conflicting (frustrating) interactions for the stability of this folded state.\n","\n","Such interactions are readily **available in the native state resolved by X-ray crystallography or NMR** for a given protein and can be extracted using a distance-based criteria (**Fig. 1**). In a scenario where all the interactions present in the native state are attractive, the **folding energy landscape is funneled**.
