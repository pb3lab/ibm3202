        "As we discussed during our Lectures, **the structure space is rather small when compared with the sequence space**. In fact, hierarchical structure classifications such as **CATH** have demonstrated that only a few proteins of the enormous pool of structures being deposited each year in the Protein Data Bank are known to provide novel folds. In this regard, it seems that we have discovered almost all protein folds. Moreover, the elegant experiment by Chothia & Lesk [Chothia C & Lesk AM (1986) _EMBO J_ 5(4), 823–826] revealed that, generally, **protein structures are quite similar between proteins when their sequence identity is > 30-40%**, with some remarkable exceptions to this rule)."
